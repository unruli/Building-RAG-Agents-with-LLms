# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agents

This repository contains examples and utilities for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents. RAG agents enhance language model responses by retrieving relevant information from external data sources.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Retrieval:** Integrates with various data sources (e.g., vector databases, document stores).
* **Contextual Response Generation:** Augments language model prompts with retrieved information.
* **Modular Design:** Enables easy integration of different retrieval and generation components.

**Getting Started:**

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies.
3.  Explore the example scripts to learn how to build your own RAG agent.

**Usage:**

Adapt the provided examples to your specific use case by configuring the data source and language model.
